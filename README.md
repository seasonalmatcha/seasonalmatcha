# Hello <img alt="wave" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="32px" />

My name is Alan!

I am a full-stack engineer with 4+ years of experience based in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Currently working as Lead Engineer at [Peoplyee](https://peoplyee.com/).

Probably not really active on github cause my company uses Gitlab.

But I still use Github for my own personal projects.

### Tech stack?

- Golang - backend and microservises
- Typescript - frontend and some backend. React and its ecosystem for frontend, express.js for backend
- Flutter - mobile app. Yes, I do some mobile development as well
- RabbitMQ - for queuing system and asynchronous communication
- Valkey - caching strategy
- AWS, GCP, Docker - yeah, have to take care the infrastructure as well

### OS, text editor, and other tools?

Linux + Neovim + Tmux + Window Manager = ðŸ‘Œ

Although still use MacOS, mostly because I need it to build iOS apps
